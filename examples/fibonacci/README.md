This is demonstration of a basic program that should execute well inside `mozak-vm`. Internally this calculates fibonacci sequence.

# To run

To build for Mozak-VM:

```sh
# inside examples directory
# [overseer/0-0]
cargo build --release --bin fibonacci
```

After this, run prove-and-verify on this: (to be done)
```sh
```
