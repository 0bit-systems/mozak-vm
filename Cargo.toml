# Project structuring
# ---------------------------
# The workspace deals with crates for different compilation
# targets, two in particular: `mozak` for zk-platform mozak and `native`.
# `native` targets are supposed to be built for dev machines'
# specifications e.g. `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` or `aarch64-apple-darwin`.
# `mozak` targets are supposed to be built with
# https://github.com/0xmozak/mozak-vm/blob/main/examples/.cargo/riscv32im-mozak-zkvm-elf.json
#
# The `members` described below list only crates with `native` target
#
# Crates that target `mozak` while live in the same repository, do not form
# the part of this workspace
